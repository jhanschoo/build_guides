# Soldering the controller

Use the set of holes that are outlined by the silkscreen. Keep in mind the orientation of the pinout of the controller, as well as that the the controller should normally be soldered so that it sits on the the **top** face of the keyboard.

## with headers

Insert the headers. Solder in place.

## with sockets

Insert the sockets and secure them in place with kapton or electrical tape. Flip the pcb over and solder in place. Once finished, turn the pcb over and remove the tape.

Next, cover the actual sockets with kapton or electrical tape. Poke holes through the tape into the sockets using an LED leg, pick tool, or needle. Lay controller over sockets. Insert diode or LED legs in place, starting with just the 4 corner sockets. Clip to height. Solder in place. Insert remaining pins, clip, and solder.
